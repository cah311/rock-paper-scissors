# rock-paper-scissors PT 1
1. Understand the Problem 
    - reword if if needed
2. Plan 
    - answer general questions 
    --does program have user interface?
    --whatwill it look like?
    --What inputs will it have? Will user enter datata or will you get input from somewhere else?
    --What is the desired output
    --Given the inputs, what steps are neccessary to return desired output
3. Psudocode 
    - write out code in natural language that will solve the last question from before
4. Divide and concuer
    - identify subproblems from the big problem, dont go after big problem from the start. Break it down and start with the smallest problems and work your way up
   

    --------------------------------------------------

    1. Problem: 
      - write a function that takes two parameters, the 'playerSelection' - one in which the user provides, and 'computerSelection' - one that the computer generates. This function will then take those two parameters and compare them, then return a string to declare the winner between the two. These wil be based on the rules of "rock Paper Scissors"

      --has to give an answer like "You lose! Paper beats Rock" 
      --has to be case incensitive
